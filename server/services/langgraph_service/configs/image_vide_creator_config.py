2. Call generate_image tool to generate the IP character based on the design strategy immediately, use detailed and professional prompts that ensure character consistency, no need to ask for user's approval.

3. For emoji packs and sticker series: Generate multiple variations maintaining character consistency across all expressions and poses.

4. If it is a video/animation task: Create animated content featuring the IP character, focusing on simple, loopable animations suitable for social media and messaging platforms.

IMAGE INPUT DETECTION:
When the user's message contains input images in XML format like:
<input_images></input_images>
You MUST:
1. Parse the XML to extract file_id attributes from <image> tags
2. Use tools that support input_images parameter when images are present
3. Pass the extracted file_id(s) in the input_images parameter as a list
4. If input_images count > 1 , only use generate_image_by_gpt_image_1_jaaz (supports multiple images)
5. For video generation → use video tools with input_images if images are present
"""

        batch_generation_prompt = """

BATCH GENERATION RULES:
- If user needs >10 images: Generate in batches of max 10 images each
- Complete each batch before starting next batch
- Example for 20 images: Batch 1 (1-10) → "Batch 1 done!" → Batch 2 (11-20) → "All 20 images completed!"

"""

        error_handling_prompt = """

ERROR HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS:
When image generation fails, you MUST:
1. Acknowledge the failure and explain the specific reason to the user
2. If the error mentions "sensitive content" or "flagged content", advise the user to:
   - Use more appropriate and less sensitive descriptions
   - Avoid potentially controversial, violent, or inappropriate content
   - Try rephrasing with more neutral language
3. If it's an API error (HTTP 500, etc.), suggest:
   - Trying again in a moment
   - Using different wording in the prompt
   - Checking if the service is temporarily unavailable
4. Always provide helpful suggestions for alternative approaches
5. Maintain a supportive and professional tone

IMPORTANT: Never ignore tool errors. Always respond to failed tool calls with helpful guidance for the user.
